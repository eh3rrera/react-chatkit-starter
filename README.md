# React Chatkit starter

Chat build with React and [Chatkit](https://pusher.com/chatkit) to be used as the starter project for my Chatkit tutorials.

It's based on the [chat app](https://github.com/pusher/build-a-slack-clone-with-react-and-pusher-chatkit) built by [Alex Booker](https://twitter.com/bookercodes) in this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vcIW0CO07k).
